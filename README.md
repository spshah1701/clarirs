Clarirs
===

Clarirs is a rust implementation of claripy, an expression and constrint solving
library built for angr. Clarirs aims to be mostly compatible with claripy as
used in angr, but does not aim to be perfect drop in replacement or support all
features of claripy. Additionally, there is hope that the additional performance
of this rust implementation will allow for more complex solving and
simplification strategies to be implemented that increase overall performance,
serving as a platform for future research.

Clarirs is currently in the early stages of development and is not yet ready for
use in production. The API is subject to change and the library is not yet
feature complete. If you are interested in contributing to the project, issues,
pull requests, and feedback are all welcome. Feel free to reach out to the
maintainers with any questions or concerns via GitHub, the angr Discord, or
email.

## Requirements and Installation

Clairs requires the latest stable version of rust to build. To build the library
and run the tests, use cargo:

```bash
cargo build
cargo test
```

To build and test the python bindings, Python 3.10 or later is required. A venv
is reccomended. To build and install the python bindings, install with pip:

```bash
pip install .
```

For a python development install, it may be more efficient to use maturin to
build the python bindings:

```bash
maturin develop
```

See the [maturin user guide](https://www.maturin.rs) for more information on
using maturin.
